This is a Go (http://golang.org) version of a sudoku solver, translated from the
clever and elegant solution by Peter Norvig http://norvig.com/sudoku.html

To compile and run the solver for all tests in sudoku_test.go and the problem set in 
hardest.txt just type:

$ cd sudoku
$ go test

Edit file hardest.txt to include your own problem set to be solved.
